This lecture has a bit of overlap with the next one, particularly on
FFS.

A better organization might be to consolidate a bit, then add stuff
about LFS and logical volume management/RAID to the next lecture.
Even though LFS itself is not used much these days, the idea of logs
is important enough that it is probably worth more than the few slides
on a write-ahead log for XFS.  Also, given the synergy between LFS and
RAID5, not to mention things like NetApp's WAFL that were probably
heavily inspired by LFS.

Another thing missing from this lecture and the next is some kind of
"contract" between the application and the file system.  I never
explicitly state what a file system should guarantee--namely that if
you've called fsync your file will be there, and that if you haven't
modified a file within the last 30 seconds, then that file should be
there after a reboot.  Explicitly stating that (rather than implicitly
appealing to it) might make the whole synchronous disk writes thing
easier to explain.
