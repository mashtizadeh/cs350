* x86 transactional memory

XBEGIN
XABORT
XCOMMIT

Design patterns:

   Use to insert in hash table (like fine-grained locks)

   Memory barrier--fill your cache then loop until someone else
   touches one of the cache lines.  (Like epoll for your cache.)

Note that while transactions avoid deadlock, with transactional memory
have to be able to fall back to regular locking if the transaction
doesn't work.

Can nest transactions
