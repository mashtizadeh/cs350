In description of fair queuing, sort of glossed over what time is.
The point is that virtual time advances at a rate inversely proportional
to the number of flows with packets queued, which tne corresponds to SVT
(for BFT) and global_pass (for stride scheduling).  Without explaining
that, the fair queuing analogy gets lost on people.
